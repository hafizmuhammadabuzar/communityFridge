            <p>With huge amounts of food wastage globally and so many needy; it was only a matter of time before people teamed up and found a solution. Many communities around the world have gotten together and setup shared fridges / shelves. We wanted to contribute to such wonderful initiatives; saw a gap that a bit of technology could help fill. Simply put, we provide an easy to use mapping platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Community Fridge -</strong> Global Database of Sharing; our mobile application and website is an easy mapping platform, which helps individuals to locate nearby locations. The app provides a number of smart options to not only locate nearby fridges but also see their status.</p>
