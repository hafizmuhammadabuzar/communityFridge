    <h1>About Us </h1>
    	<p>With huge amounts of food wastage globally and so many needy; it was only a matter of time before people teamed up and found a solution. Many communities around the world have gotten together and setup shared fridges / shelves. We wanted to contribute to such wonderful initiatives; saw a gap that a bit of technology could help fill. Simply put, we provide an easy to use mapping platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Community Fridge -</strong> Global Database of Sharing; our mobile application and website is an easy mapping platform, which helps individuals to locate nearby locations. The app provides a number of smart options to not only locate nearby fridges but also see their status.</p>
            
            <h3>How Does it Work  </h3>
         	<p>Download and install the mobile app and you can instantly see location pins. Create an account or use your Facebook login, and then you can add and maintain your fridges. </p>
            
             <h3>How Can You Use It </h3>
            <p>Simply create an account and add a fridge. However, some areas / countries have restrictions. If you are part of an organization or group of volunteers, just drop us an email or give us a call, we will setup the system for you to use.   </p>
                        
            <h3>What Ifâ€¦ </h3>
            <p>Fridges, food quality, fridge status and such are the responsibility of the organization and /or the individual who owns the fridge. We simply provide a mapping platform and have to no direct involvement in the operation of the fridges.</p>
